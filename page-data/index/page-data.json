These relationships typically have a long-tail distribution due to their compositional nature. This problem gets more severe when the vocabulary becomes large, rendering this task very challenging. This paper shows that modeling an effective message-passing flow through an attention mechanism can be critical to tackling the compositionality and long-tail challenges in VRR. The method, called RelTransformer, represents each im- age as a fully-connected scene graph and restructures the whole scene into the relation-triplet and global-scene contexts. It directly passes the message from each element in the relation-triplet and global-scene contexts to the target relation via self-attention. We also design a learnable memory to augment the long-tail relation representation learning. Through extensive experiments, we find that our model generalizes well on many VRR benchmarks. Our model outperforms the best-performing models on two large-scale long-tail VRR benchmarks, VG8K-LT (+2.0% overall acc) and GQA-LT (+26.0% overall acc), both having a highly skewed distribution towards the tail. It also achieves strong results on the VG200 relation detection task.

It causes severe biases of the head classes (with majority samples) against the tailed ones. This renders \"how to appropriately define and alleviate the bias\" one of the most important issues. Prior works mainly use label distribution or mean score information to indicate a coarse-grained bias. In this paper, we explore to excavate the confusion matrix, which carries the fine-grained misclassification details, to relieve the pairwise biases, generalizing the coarse one. To this end, we propose a novel Pairwise Class Balance (PCB) method, built upon a confusion matrix which is updated during training to accumulate the ongoing prediction preferences. PCB generates fightback soft labels for regularization during training. Besides, an iterative learning paradigm is developed to support a progressive and smooth regularization in such debiasing. PCB can be plugged and played to any existing methods as a complement. Experiments results on LVIS demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without bells and whistles. Superior results across various architectures show the generalization ability.

In practice, one-stage detectors are more prevalent in the industry because they have a simple and fast pipeline that is easy to deploy. However, in the long-tailed scenario, this line of work has not been explored so far. In this paper, we investigate whether one-stage detectors can perform well in this case. We discover the primary obstacle that prevents one-stage detectors from achieving excellent performance is: categories suffer from different degrees of positive-negative imbalance problems under the long-tailed data distribution. The conventional focal loss balances the training process with the same modulating factor for all categories, thus failing to handle the long-tailed problem. To address this issue, we propose the Equalized Focal Loss (EFL) that rebalances the loss contribution of positive and negative samples of different categories independently according to their imbalance degrees. Specifically, EFL adopts a category-relevant modulating factor which can be adjusted dynamically by the training status of different categories. Extensive experiments conducted on the challenging LVIS v1 benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. With an end-to-end training pipeline, EFL achieves 29.2% in terms of overall AP and obtains significant performance improvements on rare categories, surpassing all existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, it goes against the practical applications in the real world which suffer from a heavy class imbalance problem, known as the long-tailed object detection. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Adaptive Hierarchical Representation Learning (AHRL), from a metric learning perspective to address long-tailed object detection. We visualize each learned class representation in the feature space, and observe that some classes, especially under-represented scarce classes, are prone to cluster with analogous ones due to the lack of discriminative representation. Inspired by this, we propose to split the whole feature space into a hierarchical structure and eliminate the problem in a divide-and-conquer way. AHRL contains a two-stage training paradigm. First, we train a normal baseline model and construct the hierarchical structure under the unsupervised clustering method. Then, we design an AHR loss that consists of two optimization objectives. On the one hand, AHR loss retains the hierarchical structure and keeps representation clusters away from each other. On the other hand, AHR loss adopts adaptive margins according to specific class pairs in the same cluster to further optimize locally. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging LVIS dataset and AHRL outperforms all the existing state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods, with 29.1% segmentation AP and 29.3% box AP on LVIS v0.5 and 27.6% segmentation AP and 28.7% box AP on LVIS v1.0 based on ResNet-101. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline to help stimulate future research in long-tailed object detection.

Naive training produces models that are biased toward common classes in terms of higher accuracy. The key to addressing LTR is to balance various aspects including data distribution, training losses, and gradients in learning. We explore an orthogonal direction,  weight balancing , motivated by the empirical observation that the naively trained classifier has \"artificially\" larger weights in norm for common classes (because there exists abundant data to train them, unlike the rare classes). We investigate three techniques to balance weights, L2-normalization, weight decay, and MaxNorm. We first point out that L2-normalization \"perfectly\" balances per-class weights to be unit norm, but such a hard constraint might prevent classes from learning better classifiers. In contrast, weight decay penalizes larger weights more heavily and so learns small balanced weights; the MaxNorm constraint encourages growing small weights within a norm ball but caps all the weights by the radius. Our extensive study shows that both help learn balanced weights and greatly improve the LTR accuracy. Surprisingly, weight decay, although underexplored in LTR, significantly improves over prior work. Therefore, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm and propose a simple approach to LTR: (1) learning features using the cross-entropy loss by tuning weight decay, and (2) learning classifiers using class-balanced loss by tuning weight decay and MaxNorm. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on five standard benchmarks, serving as a future baseline for long-tailed recognition.","citations":2,"title":"Long-Tailed Recognition via Weight Balancing","twitter":{"likes":166,"replies":4,"retweets":30,"ids":["1508636533884166148","1508636533884166148","1526487407738036224","1526487407738036224","1539012116862074881","1539012116862074881","1508639308722290689","1508639308722290689"]},"id":"3697c677-7631-5eb4-9bec-3e626ff908d7","s2id":"cc8e9f795f83c5107816bd500acb13c4e200198c","pdf":"/content/CVPR2022/papers/Alshammari_Long-Tailed_Recognition_via_Weight_Balancing_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf","posterSession":"CVPR","authors":["Shaden Alshammari","Yu-Xiong Wang","Deva Ramanan","Shu Kong"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14197"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Long-tailed data is still a big challenge for deep neural networks, even though they have achieved great success on balanced data. We observe that vanilla training on long-tailed data with cross-entropy loss makes the instance-rich head classes severely squeeze the spatial distribution of the tail classes, which leads to difficulty in classifying tail class samples. Furthermore, the original cross-entropy loss can only propagate gradient short-lively because the gradient in softmax form rapidly approaches zero as the logit difference increases. This phenomenon is called softmax saturation. It is unfavorable for training on balanced data, but can be utilized to adjust the validity of the samples in long-tailed data, thereby solving the distorted embedding space of long-tailed problems. To this end, this paper proposes the Gaussian clouded logit adjustment by Gaussian perturbation of different class logits with varied amplitude. We define the amplitude of perturbation as cloud size and set relatively large cloud sizes to tail classes. The large cloud size can reduce the softmax saturation and thereby making tail class samples more active as well as enlarging the embedding space. To alleviate the bias in a classifier, we therefore propose the class-based effective number sampling strategy with classifier re-training.

Recently, the ensembling based methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance and show great potential. However, there are two limitations for current methods. First, their predictions are not trustworthy for failure-sensitive applications. This is especially harmful for the tail classes where the wrong predictions is basically frequent. Second, they assign unified numbers of experts to all samples, which is redundant for easy samples with excessive computational cost. To address these issues, we propose a Trustworthy Long-tailed Classification (TLC) method to jointly conduct classification and uncertainty estimation to identify hard samples in a multi-expert framework. Our TLC obtains the evidence-based uncertainty (EvU) and evidence for each expert, and then combines these uncertainties and evidences under the Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory (DST). Moreover, we propose a dynamic expert engagement to reduce the number of engaged experts for easy samples and achieve efficiency while maintaining promising performances. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the tasks of classification, tail detection, OOD detection and failure prediction.

Recently, researchers have investigated the potential of supervised contrastive learning for long-tailed recognition, and demonstrated that it provides a strong performance gain. In this paper, we show that while supervised contrastive learning can help improve performance, past baselines suffer from poor uniformity brought in by imbalanced data distribution. This poor uniformity manifests in samples from the minority class having poor separability in the feature space. To address this problem, we propose targeted supervised contrastive learning (TSC), which improves the uniformity of the feature distribution on the hypersphere. TSC first generates a set of targets uniformly distributed on a hypersphere. It then makes the features of different classes converge to these distinct and uniformly distributed targets during training. This forces all classes, including minority classes, to maintain a uniform distribution in the feature space, improves class boundaries, and provides better generalization even in the presence of long-tail data.

We reveal that the real culprit lies in the extremely imbalanced distribution of the classifier's weight norm. For conventional softmax cross-entropy loss, such imbalanced weight norm distribution yields ill conditioned decision boundary for categories which have small weight norms. To get rid of this situation, we choose to maximize the cosine similarity between the learned feature and the weight vector of target category rather than the inner-product of them. The decision boundary between any two categories is the angular bisector of their weight vectors. Whereas, the absolutely equal decision boundary is suboptimal because it reduces the model's sensitivity to various categories. Intuitively, categories with rich data diversity should occupy a larger area in the classification space while categories with limited data diversity should occupy a slightly small space. Hence, we devise a Category-Aware Angular Margin Loss (C2AM Loss) to introduce an adaptive angular margin between any two categories. Specifically, the margin between two categories is proportional to the ratio of their classifiers' weight norms. As a result, the decision boundary is slightly pushed towards the category which has a smaller weight norm. We conduct comprehensive experiments on LVIS dataset.
